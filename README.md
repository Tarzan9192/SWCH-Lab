# Meteor-React Boilerplate
This boiler plate allows you to publish items from the database.

## Using this boilerplate for the first time
1. Clone this repo to your desired location
2. Rename the files to whatever you please.
3. Play around with the code and learn how everything connects.
4. Once you're ready to run the program, please follow these commands:  
    **meteor npm install --save** (this installs all of the necessary npm packages)  
    **meteor** (this executes the webapp)  
5. If you're going to push this to your own repo, be sure to create the project first on github and follow the instructions.

Happy Learning!! ^__^
